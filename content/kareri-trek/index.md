# Kareri Trek (Not updated yet)

- Snow boots / waterproof shoes
- Waterbottle

7 friends of mine and I stayed in McLeodgunj that is a twin of Dharamshala. Our journey started with an SUV that dropped us at the starting point of the trek near Barnet. Mind you, this is a 3 day one, technically. There is an option for 2 day trek where you will probably be dropped off at Kareri village directly. We chose the 3 day one where we had to trek to the Kareri village.

We started the trek by climbing down immediately that took us into woods with tall standing pine trees that looked upon us, screening us from the heat as we were sweating our asses off. Yes, we were sweating even in the mountains of Himachal. Stones are slippery here. So yeah, we carefully placed our steps on this muddy trail. As visibility improved occasionally, we looked, held held high, at the mountains with albino patches of snow, hoping that we would be setting our camp there. Little did we know it was a long trek before we could reach the base camp. Spoiler alert: we didnt reach the lake.
