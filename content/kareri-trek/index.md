# Kareri Trek (Not updated yet)

- Snow boots / waterproof shoes
- Waterbottle

  7 friends of mine and I stayed in McLeodgunj that is a twin of Dharamshala. Our journey started with an SUV that dropped us at the starting point of the trek near Barnet. Mind you, this is a 3 day one, technically. There is an option for 2 day trek where you will probably be dropped off at Kareri village directly. We chose the 3 day one where we had to trek to the Kareri village. 
  
  We started the trek by climbing down immediately that took us into woods with tall standing pine trees that looked upon us, screening us from the heat as we were sweating our asses off. Yes, we were sweating even in the mountains of Himachal. We began to see groups of fellow trekkers ahead of us. But they they were headed to another place, it wasnt  Kareri lake. We being 8 of us were enough to keeps ourselves entertained. A friend of mine learnt the hard way that stones are slippery. So yeah, we carefully placed our steps this muddy trail. As visibility improved occasionally, we looked, held held high, at the mountains with albino patches of snow, hoping that we would be setting our camp there. Little did we know it was a long trek before we could reach the base camp. Spoiler alert: we didnt reach the lake.

After reaching up, you will have a glimpse of how heaven might look. There is a plateau on top covered with clouds and visibility is around 100 meters only. There are many ponds on the top and small waterfalls where you can take a dip. Although, I suggest against entering into ponds for safety reasons.

There is no point in changing your clothes up on the top since it will be raining like from every direction. So change at Lonavala railway station waiting room. From Bhaje, you will get autos to reach Malavli or Lonavala. From Lonavala, catch a train to reach your place.

PS: We didn't see the flag mentioned above and simply went straight ahead for about 2-3 km! The road was terrible and we didn't realize it until the road started going downhill. It was adventurous though. We got to see different views of the hill and found many waterfalls.

Happy and safe trekking!
