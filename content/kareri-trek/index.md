After reaching up, you will have a glimpse of how heaven might look. There is a plateau on top covered with clouds and visibility is around 100 meters only. There are many ponds on the top and small waterfalls where you can take a dip. Although, I suggest against entering into ponds for safety reasons.

There is no point in changing your clothes up on the top since it will be raining like from every direction. So change at Lonavala railway station waiting room. From Bhaje, you will get autos to reach Malavli or Lonavala. From Lonavala, catch a train to reach your place.

PS: We didn't see the flag mentioned above and simply went straight ahead for about 2-3 km! The road was terrible and we didn't realize it until the road started going downhill. It was adventurous though. We got to see different views of the hill and found many waterfalls.

Happy and safe trekking!
