# Monsoon Trek to Visapur Fort

- A hooded raincoat is a must in monsoon (rained all day during our trip)
- polythene carry bag(s) to pack all stuff to be kept dry (clothes, towel, smartphones)
- extra pair of clothes and socks and a towel
- water bottle
- some packed food and energy drinks (snacks and alike, not too spicy though)
- wear sport shoes

Three of us started our journey in the early morning. Caught a local train from Mumbai to reach Thane. From Thane, boarded Indrayani express to reach Lonavala. It started drizzling at Lonavala and had to take our raincoats out.

It's hard to get seats online, so book tickets early or, book them offline to get wait-listed tickets, so that you can at least board the train. We booked last minute offline ones, yet we got seats for some part of the journey. From Lonavala, local auto-rickshaws charged us 300 (3 people) to get to the Base village - Bhaje. Alternatively, you can choose to go till Malavli from Lonavala via local train and walk from Malavli to Bhaje.

From Bhaje, you have to take the road uphill that leads to Lohagad Fort until you reach hotel Viraj.

Here, take left for Visapur Fort road. Take the help of people around there if you get confused. From here, the road is slightly muddy. Follow this path until you reach a small hut/stall. Eat and energize here if you want. Walk a few steps ahead to find a flag that says 'Visapur Fort' in Hindi.

As you reach Visapur, it rains endlessly. Unless your backpack is completely waterproof, it is preferable to use that raincoats cover your backpacks too while wearing (even if you have a waterproof cover for your bag).

Here starts the trek. A trek up a beautiful waterfall. This must take 30 to 40 mins. Just be careful with all the slippery rocks. Hold rocks that are stable (which do not shake). Bend your body and climb up.

After reaching up, you will have a glimpse of how heaven might look. There is a plateau on top covered with clouds and visibility is around 100 meters only. There are many ponds on the top and small waterfalls where you can take a dip. Although, I suggest against entering into ponds for safety reasons.

There is no point in changing your clothes up on the top since it will be raining like from every direction. So change at Lonavala railway station waiting room. From Bhaje, you will get autos to reach Malavli or Lonavala. From Lonavala, catch a train to reach your place.

PS: We didn't see the flag mentioned above and simply went straight ahead for about 2-3 km! The road was terrible and we didn't realize it until the road started going downhill. It was adventurous though. We got to see different views of the hill and found many waterfalls.

Happy and safe trekking!
