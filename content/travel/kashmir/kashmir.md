# My days in Kashmir

When you hear Kashmir, pleasant and gorgeous arent exactly the things you imagine, especially because of the recent past of the unfortuante place. For the neighbouring twin countries, the perception of this place has somehow over years has turned to a gloomy one. Recent data shows that most people that visit the state of Jammu and Kashmir are piligrims of Mata Vaishnov Devi and Amrnath Yatra. Little portion visited the valley thiough. Despite, it is this people that really address the beauty off it. the place Little do people know what this gorgeous valley actually is. Located between Pir Panjal and the Himalayas, this bosoms many winter hill stations in and around. Not to be confused, the place is in its grandeur in summers too (June - Auguest). That is when I visited. After staying in Delhi recently for a couple of days, I was simply floating cloud nine and got easily accustomed to the hospitality the people of Kashmir had shown. 

You find people of all ages here and everyone of them is enthusiastic and a keen well wisher. One thing Kashmiris are trying really hard after what happened with the place is working hard to build best image of the place. After all, all the buisness here is dependent on the tourists and they make sure that the tourists, in any way, get all the help that they can get. In a week stay in Kashmir I got to hear many stories from many people around here. trouble 

Atleast that is the idea. But it shouldn't be. When you visit Kashmir and if you are 

- Snow boots / waterproof shoes
- Water bottle

## Trek deal


Airport to Gulmarg directly (7 seater): 2300. Instead take this route: Airport -> Service cars' stand -> in Srinagar city (near Dal Lake, perhaps near Ghat No. 1) -> Tnagmarg - > Gulmarg. Service cars cost quite less. Return to Srinagar from Gulmarg: Gulmarg to Tangmarg cost 50 per head. Tangmarg to Srinigar might cost 100-150 per head (we took cab 1000 for 3 people, 7 seater)
Oyo rooms Gulmarg Inn: cheap stay at 1600 for 3, per night, per room. That pretty low!

Srinagar to Sonamarg: 
Srinagar -> Ganderbal - 35 per head
Ganderbal -> Kangan (there are two Kangans on the map, this is the one that comes first) - 70
Kangan -> Sonamarg - 120 per head

cheap stay at Sonamarg: as low as 800, small room, queen size bed though. with carpet and geyser. no toileteries given. all western style. 
Better stay: Hotel Glacier heights, 2500 for 3, per night. per room. Majestic views, great restaurant food, there is a lawn to have coffee with view, big verandah to witness the mountain ranges and yes, click pics.

Sonamarg to Srinagar: again, 120 + 70 + 35 per head

Dal lake stay: 3000 for 3, per night, per room. Awesome stay (morning star boat house, great food, esp. nonveg). Prices shoot up in winter, they said
Dal lake stay: 2500 for 3, per night, per room. Awesome stay. (some nam
Shikhara: 2200 for 3 hr ride to and fro from Char Chinar. You can row the shikhara too! 
Also, dont buy anything on the Shikhara, they are decieving prices.

hookah 1200, unlimited but only on shikhara, 150 moonstone earrings (my friend bought it for 500, came to know, another seller has selling price of 150 :P)
small shikhara as token 100rs
Qawah cans of 250gm for 200 rs (at least in  the market near the airport) mostly dont buy anything in the city market. Things are pretty cheap in the floating market on Dal Lake, shikhara guy will take you there). 1500 medium ride(1hr), 1800 longer ride(90min), 1200 short ride (45min). I think all include floating market visit. BUt instead just roam the lake. GO market some time later for cheaper price (may be 500?)
Floating market: sweaters start from 500, shawls and stolls from 150. Any starting price higher than this, the shopkeeper is fooling you.


There are local buses in the city that will take you mostly anywhere inside the city. For airport take an auto till the main gate of the airport for 400 for 3 people. There is amrket here too, make last minute purchases here. walk to the airport for a 1km inside the main gate after a quick customs.
