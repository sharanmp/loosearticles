## Trek deal

We went for a 3-day trek deal. That included a 2-day food. Itinerary is as follows:

- Day 1: Travel to Barnet from McLeodganj/Dharamshala
- Day 1: Start the trek from Barnet to reach Kareri village by evening. Have dinner(provided) and have a good night's sleep
- Day 2: Have breakfast (provided) and go the trekking point. Tents will be carried by your guides. (look in essentials)


7 friends of mine and I the night at dorm in McLeodganj (twin of Dharamshala). Our journey started with an SUV that dropped us at the starting point of the trek near Barnet. Mind you, this is a 3 day one, technically. There is an option for 2 day trek where you will probably be dropped off at Kareri village directly. We chose the 3 day one where we had to trek to the Kareri village.

We started the trek by climbing down immediately that took us into woods with tall standing pine trees that looked upon us, screening us from the heat as we were sweating our asses off. Yes, we were sweating even in the mountains of Himachal. Stones are slippery here. So yeah, we carefully placed our steps on this muddy trail. As visibility improved occasionally, we looked, held held high, at the mountains with albino patches of snow, hoping that we would be setting our camp there. Little did we know it was a long trek before we could reach the base camp. Spoiler alert: we didn't reach the lake.

We found these beautiful pine cones. There were hundreds lying around. We decided it was best not to pick any.

Moving on, we crossed a tangerine tinted stream via bridge. The path then follows a muddy trail again to join a road. Our guide basically took a combination of muddy trails and cement roads to judiciously shorten our trek time as much as possible. To keep yourselves entertained, click amazing pics like this wherever you take rest stops.

We came across lush green step farming for most of our trek now. For the last part of trek to the Kareri village, there is a hill to be climbed. If you too tired to talk this inclined path, you can ask your guide to take you along the road. Of course, you will trading off for a longer route. We were relieved to reach the village after such a tiresome walk through such a treacherous path. Although this part of the trek was kind of an experience one should 'have', I would skip this part if I plan to visit Kareri again. This long trek didn't seem that enjoyable. But a experience one should have if you haven't taken  long treks ever. I will leave the judgement to you. 

We reached the accommodation, freshened up and surprisingly had some energy left to play cards. Hot dinner was served and we all went to sleep like a baby for we had to start another trek in the morning. After having breakfast and filling our water bottles, we packed gor rid of non essential stuff in the room and headed for trekking point. Our guide took us to to a bridge beside which the trail for Kareri lake starts. This part is where denser forests can be seen. Stepping stones are layed all along the trail till the lake. Although we could follow this blindly, its always wise to follow the guide as there are forks in the path in between.

It started drizzling. That grew to rain very hard. We took shelter in a shed for sometime.  As we reach the camp, the trail is rocky with a layer of snow on it. As we were trekking in March, snow was not melted completely. In fact, it was quite thick at places. So thick that our legs went knee deep sometimes. Again, its wise to follow steps of the guide, literally. Always step on hard ground. Use sticks (as recommended to carry by your guide) to hit the ground and check loose ground. Finally, we reached the camping place. Took some rest and had some food at the canteen there. It started raining and snowing. We could see snow flakes melt as soon as they touched our gloves. It was.. a new experience. It quickly became too cold to bear in the evening. We lit up some fire, mind you its very difficult in such places. We have guides to thank to. We dried up our socks by BBQing them on fire. As fire went off, we quickly cocooned ourselves in sleeping bags and hoped we would trek to lake in the morning.

You see, nature had other plans though. The night we spent camping was probably the most horrific nightmare ever. At night it started snowing and raining, very heavily. It was a thundershower. Water fled our tents. But we had some insulation beneath us. Yet, our sleeping bags got very cold and wet. Its very hard to keep things dry in such places. TO add to our list of things that could go wrong, our tents were shaking due to speedy winds. But this was not our main concern. The thunders felt so real and near, we nearly shit ourselves. The fear of thunders launching an avalanche was simply nerve wreaking. I could imagine us flowing down embedded in snow down the mountain where the avalanche took us. Those avalanche videos on the internet I saw out of curiosity cam very handy in this picture. Trembling in fear all the options we had was just to ignore and fall asleep. And we did. TO sum it, it wasn't quite cozy.

Somehow the night passed and we were all happy and merry that the thunderstorm didn't kill us. We all laughed how we nearly shit ourselves, only to see outside that nature planted a fresh layer of snow. To disappoint more, weather was turning bad again. Cloud started to crowd the sky and it all started to fog around. Half of us sincerely doubted trekking further. And wisely, we opted to not to go any further. We simply climbed a little more to reach a shiva temple and returned back to the camp. As we trekked back, the fog reduced the visibility to few meters. It was like walking in the heaven, if there is one. I believe this is it.

After reaching the village, we planned to reach McLeodganj via a vehicle to save us some time for roaming around. 

Happy trekking.
