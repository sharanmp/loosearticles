# Does RAM size matter?

Does size matter? Well, we may not know the answer to that time immemorial question, but we do know that the size of your computer memory matters. RAM, short for (Random Access Memory) is a part of a computer specs irrespective of OS. It is a memory but of different kind called volatile memory, unlike the hard disk which is non-volatile. What ever is stored on RAM evaporates soon as it is powered down. But, it's faster than the hard disk and costlier. That is why its size is less. There are faster and costlier memories. Lets not get into that.

Coming back to our question, RAM size matters. As a general rule, the more the better, until you no longer gain in performance. You see, more RAM means, more programs stored on this memory, and less time spent on fetching the programs' code from the hard disk, hence less waiting time. If you think your computer is sluggish, there are a number of reasons. And smaller RAM size may be one of them. 

Usually laptops come with just enough RAM and we usually do okay. But most tasks that we do on laptop require browsers like chrome to be used and chrome is one memory hogging beast. These days laptops come with a minimum of 8GB of RAM, which should be enough for a regular user. But when you go a step ahead and run programs like video editors, play heavy games, you will need a few extra gigs of RAM. That is why it is important to buy a laptop with an extra slot for RAM, so that if you feel the need to upgrade it later you can do so easily. Else, instead of buying those extra gigs, you will end up buying a RAM of whole size. When it comes with desktop, they usually have an extra slot. But for MACs, we can only go as far as being sorry :/

It is important to understand what is actually the bottle neck of your computer. In most cases, it's either the processor, RAM or the hard disk. When you see your programs stuck, open the task manager(For Windows OS, press Ctrl + Shift+ Esc) and look for a performance tab. Check which component's usage is going near 100%. In case it's the processor, there is pretty much nothing we can do but get a new computer. Processors these days are usually good enough for our daily routine. You should go for a processor based on your needs and this should be done while buying the computer. Check this guide to decide which processor to go for. There is thing thing called overclocking, which basically increases frequency of the processor to make it faster. There are legit ways of doing this (like Intel provides) and you can go beyond the permissible limit too, but then you are on your own. Unless you are into games that are computationally extensive, there is little need to do this. 

In case of hard disk, there is this option to upgrade to SSDs. This does have a significant impact on performance. Boot times are reduced quite impressively. Programs open up faster and the overall response of the OS is drastically improved. Before you add this to cart, check if the motherboard supports the appropriate protocols (its usually PCIe), frequency and the RAM technology (DDR3 or DDR4) as required by the SSD. If you see RAM being used about 80% or above, then it's time to slap few gigs on your computer.
